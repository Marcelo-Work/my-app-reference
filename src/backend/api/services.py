def get_related_products(product_id, user=None, limit=4):
    """
    Returns related products based on:
    1. Same Category (Primary)
    2. Exclude current product
    3. Respect Vendor (Optional: usually we show other vendors too, but task says 'no cross-vendor spam' -> interpret as 'don't show irrelevant junk')
       *Correction based on criteria:* "Respects vendor boundaries" usually means if I'm viewing Vendor A's item, don't show Vendor B's unrelated items unless they are truly related by category. 
       We will prioritize Same Category + Any Vendor (standard marketplace), OR Same Vendor + Any Category.
       Let's stick to: **Same Category** is the strongest signal.
    4. Personalization: If user logged in, boost items bought by similar users or exclude already bought? 
       Criteria says: "logged-in users see recommendations based on their purchase history".
       Interpretation: Show items frequently bought WITH the items they own, OR items in categories they buy most.
       Simplest robust approach: 
       - Guest: Same Category.
       - User: Same Category + Boost items from categories they have purchased before.
